# Portfolio

## Description
I did this project so future eployers can see my portfolio. They will be able to look at my work and decide if I am a good fit for their company.
The project will be the home for all of my other webpages I will create during my time in the boot camp. 
I learned how to create cards with background images and how to place them using flexbox. I continued learning how to use my external stylesheet and to make borders around my images.
